AI has the potential to create opportunities for people everywhere, bringing new waves of innovation and economic progress, and driving knowledge, learning, creativity, and productivity on a scale we haven’t seen before. The first version of Gemini, Gemini 1.0, is optimized for different sizes: Ultra, Pro, and Nano. These are the first models of the Gemini era and the first realization of the vision Google had when it formed Google DeepMind. This new era of models represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts Google has undertaken as a company."
